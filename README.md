# plant_disease_detection

The developed plant disease detection system demonstrates the effectiveness of classical image
processing techniques in identifying diseased regions on plant leaves. By leveraging color-based
segmentation, morphological filtering, and edge detection, the system successfully classifies leaves
as either healthy or diseased based on the proportion of affected pixels. This lightweight and
interpretable approach is particularly suitable for scenarios where data availability, computational
resources, or real-time processing requirements limit the use of machine learning.â€‹
